/*! Controls printing of diagnostic and debug messages.

	You are encouraged to include diagnostic and debugging
	information in your CPU, but you should include a way
	to control how much is printed. The default should be
	to print nothing, but it is a good idea to have a way
	of turning it on and off _without_ recompiling. This function
	provides a way for the user to indicate both how much
	output they are interested in, and where that output
	should go (should it go to stdout, or stderr, or a file?).
	
	\param state Valid (non-empty) CPU handle.
	
	\param level What level of output should be printed. There
	is no specific format for the output format, the only
	requirement is that for level zero there is no output.
	
	\param dest Where the output should go. This should be
	remembered by the CPU simulator, then later passed
	to fprintf to provide output.
	
	\pre It is required that if level>0 then dest!=0, so the
	caller will always provide a valid destination if they
	have indicated they will require output.
	
	It is suggested that for level=1 you print out one
	line of information per instruction with basic information
	like the program counter and the instruction type, and for higher
	levels you may want to print the CPU state before each
	instruction. Both of these can usually be inserted in
	just one place in the processor, and can greatly aid
	debugging.

	However, this is completely implementation defined behaviour,
	so your simulator does not have to print anything for
	any debug level if you don't want to. 
	
	The intent is that this function merely modifies the type
	of reporting that is performed during mips_cpu_step:
	
		// Enable basic debugging to stderr
		mips_cpu_set_debug_level(cpu, 1, stderr);
		
		// The implementation may now choose to print things
		// to stderr (what exactly is up to the implementation)
		mips_cpu_step(cpu);	// e.g. prints "pc = 0x12, encoding=R"
		
		// Tell the CPU to print nothing
		mips_cpu_set_debug_level(cpu, 0, NULL);
		
		// Now the implementation must not print any debug information
		mips_cpu_step(cpu);
		
		// Send detailed debug output to a text file
		FILE *dump=fopen("dump.txt", "wt");
		mips_cpu_set_debug_level(cpu, 2, dump);
		
		// Run lots of instructions until the CPU reports an error.
		// The implementation can write lots of useful information to
		// the file
		mips_error err=mips_Success;
		while(!err) {
			mips_cpu_step(cpu);
		};
		
		// Detach the text file, and close it
		mips_cpu_set_debug_level(cpu, 0, NULL);
		fclose(dump);
		
		// You can now read through the text file "dump.txt" to see what happened

	However, you could decide that you want to print something out
	at the point that mips_cpu_set_debug_level is called with level>0,
	such as the current PC and registers. Up to you.

	\param state Either a handle to a valid simulation state, or an empty (NULL) handle.

	It is legal to pass an empty handle to mips_cpu_free. It is illegal

		mips_cpu_free(h);	// This is fine
